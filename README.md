# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
This repository contains the code for the assignment for the Course Getting and Cleaning Data

## General considerations

1. Note that the repository also contains the data files. Although it was not needed for the exercise they have been included for completitude.
2. As the data in the Inertial folders is unlabelled data and this data is asked to be eliminated in step 2, it will not be processed since the beginning.
3. For the purpose of obtaining the mean and standard deviation, only the data which specifically stated *mean()* and *std()* has been taken into account.
